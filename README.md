## onion (v0.0)

# WIP
Used daily for production-ready applications, so it works great, but needs a little love to bring it to 0.1,
including tests and documentation.

### Usage

```
git clone
npm install
node node_modules/onion configuration.json
```

### Configuration File Format

```json
{ }
```
